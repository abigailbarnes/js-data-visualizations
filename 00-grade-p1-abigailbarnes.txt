Additional feedback: when you find yourself repeating expressions like
  layout.xScale(d.cat) + layout.xScale.bandwidth()/2
then you can create a new temp variable with, for example
  const bw = (layout.xScale.bandwidth()/2;
and/or a little helper function like:
  const xx = (d) => layout.xScale(d.cat) + layout.xScale.bandwidth()/2;
which can be used with a .attr() d3 method.
(The structure of this particular assignment, with multiple separate but similar
functions, does unfortunately require the repetition of these definitions.)
Large amounts of copy-paste-generated code (known as "copy-pasta") makes code less
useful for humans, by decreasing legibility, and increasing the work of maintenance.
*** Too much copy-pasta may be a cause for deductions in future assignments.


#cksum = 4/4 (any modifications flagged by cksum messages)

#1a = 4/4 (bars: tests that scales are working)
#1b = 4/4 (dots)
#1c = 4/4 (sticks)
#1d = 4/4 (outlineCircles)
#1e = 4/4 (sizedCircles)
#1f = 4/4 (roundRects)
#1g = 4/4 (coloredCircles)
#1h = 6/6 (slopes)

#2a = 4/4 (can change dataRange)
#2b = 4/4 (can change dataLen)
#2c = 4/4 (can change padding)
#2d = 4/4 (can make data with util.dataGen(dataRange, dataLen, { randomize: true }); )
#2e = 4/4 (can change styling)

#3a = 0/10 (added brief descriptive comments)
You had no comments.  The top of p1.js asked you to add brief descriptive comments to
document your thoughtful intent in the code you wrote.  Comments are vital for
helping other humans understand what your code is doing and how.
#3b = 4/4 (coloredCircles colored according to directions)
